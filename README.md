# Pomodoro Timer

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro," the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
